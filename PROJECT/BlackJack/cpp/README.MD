# BlackJack cpp 

This is my first true game where I did not look up anything online besides the random gen. I am proud of this project as it
took me a few days and I struggled trying to make it happen. Its unclean code but it works.

For more information about how it works, read the comments that I placed.

Known issues:
- Does not display the right card ammount after the 2nd hitme
- Does not display the correct fold ammount

#Project state:
