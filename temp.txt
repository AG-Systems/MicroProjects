> Six dead champions
> Reincarnated into robot bodies by migrating the brain
> Injected with a microchip that inhibits the host's memories and prevents them from relapsing to their past selves
> This microchip controls the host's thoughts and causes them to believe they are a perfect entity and that humanity is plagued
> 'Converted' PROJECTS will harm human champions and incapacitate them to be brought back to the laboratory for migration and conversion
> 2:28 is Yi officially rejecting his past life and accepting his existence as a PROJECT
> Viktor is the engineer behind the robot bodies and is reponsible for this programming
> Hence the skin 'Creator Viktor', or more aptly named, PROJECT Viktor
> This video is the beginning of the Glorious Revolution
> Yasuo, Leona, and Zed escaped the lab before being converted
> They are now trying to decomission the converted PROJECTS before they assimilate the rest of the league
> Yi, Fiora and Lucian are past being saved
> They aren't the good guys anymore
> Welcome to the League of Project
