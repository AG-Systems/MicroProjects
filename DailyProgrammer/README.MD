## Synopsis

A folder filled up with my /r/dailyprogrammer challenges that I have finished.

## Code Example

Most of it is written in C++ and maybe some in Python.

## Motivation

Finding something to program can be a hard task sometimes. /r/DailyProgrammer gives me ideas of what I want to do and have fun while doing it.

## Running it

You copy paste the code into a proper compiler ( C++ uses .cpp and Python uses .py) and run it. This folder is more seeing what I wrote and back my code up. 

## API Reference

No api has been used.

## Tests

You run it.

## Contributors

Nobody helped me besides myself. Besides looking up documentation of course and forums.

## License

Do what you want with it.
