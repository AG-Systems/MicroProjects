# A collection of my Machine Learning projects code.

A collection of all of my machine learning code I have written.

## Folder structure

Src is my first ever machine learning project. Counts every character, puts all of the characters into a vector and tries to predict whats going to be the next character. Soon will expand it to a markov chain. Each folder has their own project.
