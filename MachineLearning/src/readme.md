# C++ Character Predict.

This is my first machine learning program. Its a step below of markov chain.

## Folder structure

Each "version" is the progress I have made to my project. As you can see in the first version it has nothing while v7 is almost finished. To see the finished version please click on the "final.cpp"

## How it works:

1. Counts every character in the string
2. Creates a vector of the size of number of characters in the string.
3. Randomly picks a character in the vector.

Do whatever you want with the code. Just please credit me. :D
