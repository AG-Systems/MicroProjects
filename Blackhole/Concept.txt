Have not decided on what specifically its going to do

1.  Spread the code over the network and delete all of the data at once once it spread far enough

2.  SPreads the code over the network and then all of the data from the infomation gets transported into one compter to the netowrk
and then goes to a small group of computers in the network then goes to you.
